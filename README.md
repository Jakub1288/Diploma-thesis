**Machine learning methods for text analysis**


## Abstract
This diploma thesis deals with text analysis using machine learning methods. The 
goal of the thesis is to build and compare machine learning models using different 
classification algorithms. In the theoretical part of the thesis, individual algorithms are 
explained, followed by the process of text preprocessing and vectorization techniques. The 
end of the theoretical part describes validation approaches and evaluation metrics. The 
practical part of the thesis begins with the description of the dataset and data preparation. 
The dataset consists of documents dealing with the solvency and financial situation of 
insurance companies. Afterwards, machine learning models are built and also 
fine-tuned using the GridSearch method. Various dataset partitioning techniques are used as 
well as different text preprocessing approaches. In the conclusion and discussion chapter, 
these different approaches are evaluated and the accuracy rates of individual models are 
compared. Limitations of the solution and a suggestion for improvement and further 
processing of the work are also discussed. Python code for each part of the task is attached 
at the end of the thesis.

## Keywords
Machine learning, text analysis, binary classification, natural language 
processing, Python, scikit-learn

## Methodology
Implementation of machine learning models for classification task on text data. 
Comparison and evaluation of machine learning models. 6 different classification algorithms has been used.
The code is written in Python on JupyterLab platform.
The pdfplumber, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib and NLTK libraries are used for importing text and preprocessing steps.
Scikit-learn, Keras and TensorFlow libraries are used for building machine learning models.
